# blktests

blktests is a test framework for the Linux kernel block layer and storage
stack. It is inspired by the [xfstests](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/fs/xfs/xfstests-dev.git/)
filesystem testing framework.

## Getting Started

The dependencies are minimal, but make sure you have them installed:

- bash 4
- GNU coreutils
- GNU awk
- util-linux
- fio
- gcc
- make
- multipath-tools (Debian, openSUSE) or device-mapper-multipath (Fedora)
- dmsetup (Debian) or device-mapper (Fedora, openSUSE, Arch Linux)
- e2fsprogs and xfsprogs

For the SRP tests, tell multipathd to use the SRP multipath configuration
file:

```pushd /etc
ln -s ${BLKTESTS_PATH}/tests/srp/multipath.conf
popd
```

Add the list of block devices you want to test on in a file named `config`:

```sh
TEST_DEVS=(/dev/nvme0n1 /dev/sdb)
```

And as root, run the default set of tests with `./check`.

Note that these tests are destructive, so don't add anything to the `TEST_DEVS`
array containing data that you want to keep.

See [here](Documentation/running-tests.md) for more detailed information on
configuration and running tests.

## Adding Tests

The `./new` script creates a new test from a template. The generated template
contains more detailed documentation.

Pull requests on GitHub and patches to <linux-block@vger.kernel.org> are both
accepted. See [here](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information on contributing.
